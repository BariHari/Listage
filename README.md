### Our Idea:

A grocery list app that knows when you need each item depending on the settings you give it. For example, if you buy bread every 3 days, the app will automatically add bread to your list every 3 days!!

### Future Developments:

* Using information machine to import the customers receipts so they can keep track of their grocery expenses.
* "Add now" or "1 time only" buttons to customize the users list
* Create different lists depending on the store where the item is the cheapest
* Organize the list by aisle # so its easier for the user to go through the list at the store.
